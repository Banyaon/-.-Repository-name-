This is a generic help page for the MediaWiki software. Many MediaWiki-powered wikis have a help link that points to this page. If you came here from another wiki looking for help with logging in or creating an account, we are not able to help you. Return to your wiki and try to find a forum, talk page or contact address where you can ask for help to the admin of the site.
Dü säärst di ei uunmelde, am artiikler uuntulukin. Dü könst jo uk feranre. Man dü heest do muar mögelkhaiden, diaram skulst dü det du.

Creating a user account means that you supply a username (your real name or a nickname) and a password. The system will reject a username that is already in use. A user account is created only once. You are then "logged in". Next time you log in you supply your username again and demonstrate with the password that you are the same person.

Bearbeitungen mit einem Benutzerkonto werden unter dessen Benutzernamen aufgezeichnet. Sofern man nicht angemeldet ist, werden die Bearbeitungen unter der IP-Adresse aufgezeichnet.

Why log in?
You don't have to log in to read any public MediaWiki wiki. You don't even have to log in to edit, normally: anyone can edit almost any page, even without logging in.

However, it's still a good idea to log in, for several reasons:

Other users will be able to recognize you by your username when you make changes to pages. As a "name" an IP address is somewhat clumsy. Also, if you use computers at different locations (home, office, internet cafe, etc.) you have a different IP-address in each case; even in the same location, depending on the Internet connection, the IP-address may be different each time. Therefore a username is better to maintain an identity.
You will have your own user page where you can write a bit about yourself, and a user talk page which you can use to communicate with other users.
You will be able to mark an edit as minor, which avoids inconvenience for other users.
You will be able to keep track of changes to modules you are interested in using a watchlist.
You don't have to give your email address if you don't want to. But if you choose to give an email address, you will be able to do the following:
reset your password if you forget it
receive automatic notifications of certain events, if set in your preferences
receive emails from other users if so set in your preferences (the user who emails you will not know your email address)
email other users and administrators if they want as above (your email address will be disclosed on any email you send)
You will be able to move (rename) pages after being Autoconfirmed.
You will be able to set your own preferences, to change things such as:
the number of pages displayed in Recent changes
the fonts, colors and layout of the site, by using different skins
Remember: check the privacy policy of the individual site you're visiting, if any (for example, Wikimedia's privacy policy).

How to log in
First, make sure that your browser accepts cookies. Some browsers can accept or reject cookies from individual sites; users of these should configure the browser to accept cookies from each wiki you plan to edit, such as mediawiki.org.

Click on the "Uunmelde" link at the top right of the page. You will then be prompted to enter your username and password. If you haven't logged in before, you will need to use the link provided to create an account. You may give your email address if you like.

If you check the box "Uunmeldet bliiw", you will not have to give your password again when you access that MediaWiki wiki from the same computer. This feature will only work if your password was not generated by the MediaWiki software.

The returnto URL parameter specifies the page to redirect back to after logging in.

Log in problems
If you appear to be able to log in, but as soon as you try to look at a page you appear logged out again, it is very likely to be a cookie problem. If you are certain that cookies are enabled, make sure that you haven't inadvertently listed the wiki's domain on a list of sites for which cookies are never allowed: this feature is available in all recent browsers. Also make sure your computer's date and time are set correctly; if they are not, cookies may expire before they are supposed to. Note that some firewall and ad-blocking software may interfere with the cookie that the wiki uses to keep a person logged in.

A user may occasionally find themself "automatically" logged out in between beginning an edit and saving it, or when switching between multiple pages open in multiple windows. This can be a result of your browser's cookie, cache, or firewall settings. Regardless of the reason for the logout, the simplest solution to the problem is to check the "Uunmeldet bliiw" box. If you do this on a computer that can be accessed by more than one person (i.e. at the library, at work, at school), please find and erase your user ID cookies after your editing session.

What if I forget the password or username?
Your username is case sensitive. If you enter an email address when signing up for the account, or in your Preferences, you can make a request on the login screen for a temporary password to be sent to that address, which will allow you to retrieve your account. If you did not enter an email address, or the address was out of date, you will have to create a new account under a different username. After doing this, if a user page and user talk page were created for the old account, it is advisable to make them redirect to the equivalent pages for the new account. (To carry the content and history of these pages over to the new location, you may be able to use the "move" function ─ contact an administrator if assistance is needed.) If your IP address is blocked from editing, you will not be allowed to request a password reset from that address.

Creating an account
To create an account, select "Uunmelde" (top right of page) then "Brükerkonto iinracht". You usually need only provide a username and password. Some wikis require a visual CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). Users with text, speech, or certain old browsers will be unable to create an account if they cannot view this image. If you are unable to view captchas, contact an administrator or request an account.

You may also be unable to create an account if it contains certain symbols (particularly the '@' symbol, as well as certain non-Latin characters) or words, or if it is too similar to that of an existing user. You may then be able to request that an account is created for you by contacting an administrator, depending on the wiki's own policies and systems. If your IP address has account creation blocked, you may be able either to request to be unblocked or to request an account.

Another possibility is that you have landed on this page from a private wiki, some other method is used to manage accounts. If that is the case, contact your system administrator, to see what the processes are, to set up or access your account. One method to try, if you think this is your case, is your organization/company's domain login credentials.

Wiki families and unified login
Some projects using MediaWiki software form a family in the sense that one logs in to the family as a whole; the functioning of their systems can vary considerably. If you are interested in one of Wikimedia Foundation's wikis (such as Wikipedia), you might want to read further at: Unified login.

Logging out
You can log out any time by clicking on the "Ufmelde" link at the top right of the page. To prevent the browser from remembering your username and suggesting it to the next user of the computer, remember to delete the wiki's cookies in your browser's privacy settings. Especially if you are using a public computer, you may want to delete all of the browser's recent history (Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Del in Firefox).

Most wikis log users out automatically after a certain time. If that happens and you try to save an edit, you will normally see a warning message that you are logged out.

Si le tentativa de accesso ha essite sur un apparato o navigator que tu non ha usate ante, pois tu recipeva un aviso post le primo tentativa fallite. Si il ha essite sur un apparato o navigator note, alora le aviso ha essite configurate post cinque tentativas.

Please note that this feature relies on cookies to keep track of the devices you have used to log in. Deleting the cookies or using your browser's "incognito/private browsing" feature will cause the device to be regarded as new and, therefore, trigger the above notification as a "false positive" warning.

Que deberea io facer?
If you made this login attempt, no action needs to be taken at this time, though you should always have a strong and unique password for your account. If you don't think your password is strong, you should change your password as soon as possible. According to one study of leaked account passwords, nearly 17% of 10 million internet user accounts have “123456” as their password.[1] Don't be one of them!

If you did not make this login attempt, and you suspect that someone else has tried to access your account, you may want to change your password anyway, even if you do have a strong password.

Also, it might be a good idea to associate an email address with your account in the event you lose access to your account and want to get back in. You can set your email on the first panel of your Preferences page. You might also want to glance through this essay on how to prevent account hijacking, which has some general tips you should keep in mind when using the internet.

Failed login attempt notification on Echo

Login attempt notification as seen on a different wiki
The extension keeps track of known browsers by placing an HTTP cookie in the browser. This cookie automatically expires in 180 days. If a failed login attempt happens from a new browser, it generates an Echo notification alerting the user about the login attempt. The other way that we identify known devices is by checking the current IP address subnet against the IP addresses that have been used recently (as stored in a temporary server cache). None of the information is stored in a database and at no point is any private information revealed publicly, including the attacker’s IP address/location. The WMF Legal and Security teams have reviewed the implementation for both compliances with our Privacy Policy and security considerations.

For known devices/IPs, we allow up to 5 login attempts before alerting the user about the login attempt, since it's fairly common to mistype or forget a password. If there are 5 or more failed attempts, the notification will say: Ha occurrite 5 tentativas fallite de aperir session in tu conto depost le ultime vice que tu ha aperite session. Si tu non initiava isto, per favor assecura te que tu conto ha un contrasigno forte. There would be another notification at 10 attempts, 15 attempts and so on.

For unknown devices/IPs, we alert on every failed attempt. The extension bundles these notifications to avoid spamming users with too many notifications. For example, if there are 3 failed attempts from an unknown device, there will be a single notification, which says: Ha occurrite 3 tentativas fallite de aperir session in tu conto a partir de un nove apparato depost le ultime vice que tu ha aperite session. Si tu non initiava isto, per favor assecura te que tu conto ha un contrasigno forte..


Cosas a notar
There are two ways for users to get these notifications – either by web Echo notifications or by email. By default, the web and email notifications are on for everyone. This is configurable in the notification preferences.


Authenticationes con bon successo
The extension allows you to get an email when a user logs in successfully to your account from an unfamiliar device and IP. This is especially helpful for admins or other functionaries who are concerned that their rights might be misused. This notification is on by default. Note that the web notifications are disabled for this feature. The email text says: Alcuno (probabilemente tu) ha recentemente aperire session in tu conto a partir de un nove apparato. Si es tu, alora tu pote ignorar iste message. Si non es tu, alora es recommendate cambiar tu contrasigno e verificar le activitate de tu conto. You can disable this in your preferences.

There is a lot of advice available online about making a strong password. Here is some general advice about passwords:

"Select strong passwords – eight or more characters long, and containing letters, digits, and punctuation". (Source: Security/Password reset on Meta). Know more about passwords and security.
"As a rule of thumb, a password that is reasonably long, with a mixture of upper and lowercase letters and numbers, and not mostly made up of dictionary words or names or personal information (date of birth, cat's name, etc.) is likely to be reasonably strong for everyday use. Passwords that consist of just lowercase letters can also be reasonably strong, but they must be significantly longer". (Source: User account security on English Wikipedia).
